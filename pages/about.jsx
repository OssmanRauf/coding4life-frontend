            Well being a developer means that you will have to learn constantly
            and be aware of new features and technologies as a way to improve
            yourself(and to be honest:
            <b>
              <i> to not be left behind new opportunities</i>
            </b>
            ), Coding4Life can make that a little bit easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our Blog we are not limited to one or two developers knowledge
            and experience because Coding4Life is not designed to be a private
            blog but a public blog where all of us can participate in, and give
            our knowledge and experience to the new developers coming in the
            industry.
